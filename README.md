#### Project architecture

###### PHP

> The project uses a straight forward MVC architecture for php classes

> The project uses PSR4 for autoloading the php classes.


###### CSS

> The project uses tailwindcss for styling the components. here is an example of how to impolement tailwindcss into a vanilla php project [Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-setup-guide-of-tailwind-css-with-php/). 

> Webpack is used for bundeling ressources, for running the project, we only need the contents of the public folder as it stores the css/js bundles. When updating the project a new bundle needs to get generated by running `npm run build` in the root of the project
